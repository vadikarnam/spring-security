DIT - Directory Information Tree
DC  - domain component
OU  - organisational unit(ou)
CN  - Common name(cn) 
DN  - Distinguished Name(dn) 


LDAP is a datastore that stores the data in a hierarchical format.For example
 a user can have multiple attributes related to it such as 
 
 1. first name
 2. last name
 3. username
 4. email
 5. department
 6. roles. 
 
 NOw if you want to save these details in to DB, you need multiple tables.Since, LDAP stores the data in a hierarchical format these issues are not common in LDAP. 
 This hierarchical format is called DIT Directory Information Tree.
 
 Different LDIF(LDAP Data Interchange Format) Attributes
  --> ldif is the textual representation of LDAP.
  
 dc dc(domain component) is the top level or root of the hierarchical data that we save into LDAP. Below is an example of dc definition.

  -->  dc=devglan,dc=com
  
  ou - ou stands for organisational unit. For example, ou: finance is an entry inside dc.
  cn - cn stands for common name. For example, cn: John Doe is an entry inside ou.
  dn - dn is distinguished name and it uniquely idenntifies a particular entry in LDAP server. 
  
  Following is a dn that uniqely identifies the entry of John Doe. To define a dn, start with the cn and navigate back to the top level to dc.
  -->  cn=John Doe,ou=finance,dc=devglan,dc=com
  
  
  Here o and dc is the attribute where o is the organization.You can only use those attributes which are defined in the objectClass 
  and hence if you want to use an attribute such as o then u need to define the object class of it.
  
  	dn: dc=devglan,dc=com
	objectclass: dcObject	
	objectClass: organization
	o: Devglan
	dc: devglan
	
In the following file, we have 2 users with username/password as john/john and mike/mike. User john has ADMIN role and mike has USER role.(Added under resource)
